    You are using USAF PFA Calc - a simple, fast, easy to use utility for calculating scores for
    the United States Air Force Fitness Assessment.  I created this app because none of the other
    similar apps on the market suited my tastes.<br />
    <br />
    If you want to know more about the Air Force Fitness Assessment, check out
